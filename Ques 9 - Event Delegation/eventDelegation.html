<!-- Event Delegation is basically a pattern to handle events efficiently. -->

    <body>
        <div>
            <button>Button 1</button>
            <button>Button 2</button>
            <button>Button 3</button>
        </div>
    </body>

    <script>
        //const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('BUTTONS')

        //buttons.forEach(button => {
        //    button.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
        //        console.log(event.target.innerText)
        //    })
        //})

        const divs = document.querySelector('div')

        divs.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
            if(event.target.tagName === 'BUTTON') {
                console.log(event.target.innerText);
            }
        })
    </script>

<!--
    IN THE ABOVE EXAMPLE WITH EVENT DELEGATION, INSTEAD OF HANDLING
    THE CLICK EVENT ON BUTTON, WE CAN HANDLE IT ON DIV.

    AS YOU SEE WE COMMENTED THAT CODE WHICH HANDLES CLICK EVENT ON 
    BUTTONS INSTEAD OF DIV YOU JUST UNCOMMENT IT AND SEE WHAT CONSOLE
    SHOWS YOU WHEN YOU CLICK IN BUTTONS

    WHEN YOU CLICK ON FIRST 'BUTTON1' LOGGED ON CONSOLE, FOR SECOND
    BUTTON 'BUTTON2' IS LOGGED AND FOR THIRD BUTTON 'BUTTON3' IS 
    LOGGED.
    INSTEAD OF THIS WE JUST USE THE PARENT OR ANCESTOR THAT THEY HAVE
    TO HANDLE THE EVENT.

    IN NEXT CODE WE WILL ADD EVENT TO THE PARENT DIV OF BUTTONS. NOW WE
    HAVE JUST ONE EVENT LISTNER, BUT THE SAME LOGIC WHEN YOU CLICK BUTTON1
    AND SAME THING FOR OTHER BUTTONS.


    NOW WITH THE HELP OF EVENT DELEGATION, YOU CREATE FEWER EVENT LISTNERS
    AND PERFORMS SIMILAR EVENT-BASED LOGIN IN ONE PLACE.

    EVENT DELEGATION IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF EVENT PROPOGATION IN DOM.
