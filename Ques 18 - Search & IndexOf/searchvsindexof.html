<!--
    The Both are two search methods of JavaScript :
    1. Search() - cannot take the second argument, which is the position
                    argument. The position or startIndex argument is 
                    used when w need to start searching from a specified
                    index instead of from start.
    2. IndexOf() - Cannot perform search against a regular expression
